## How does it work?

You can check some tutorials/doc/examples [here](./docs/readme.md)

I am making also a small "game" to demonstrate how things work. You can check it out opening this repository using godot 4.x (stable) and pressing the play button.

# Networking Attributes, Effects and Abilities

Did not test too much, but abilities, effects and attributes could be simply replicated using the `MultiplayerSynchronizer` node provided by godot4.x.
